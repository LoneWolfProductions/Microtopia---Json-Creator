This tool is designed specifically to provide the Microtopia Wiki with accurate and up-to-date game data.

It processes and converts FODS files from the game Microtopia into clean JSON format.
The tool fetches FODS files directly from the Steam game folder from Microtopia,
and generates corresponding JSON files ensuring data integrity by not modifying the original data.

All FODS files and their sheets are converted, whether they are actively used or not. 
This approach ensures future-proofing, leaving it up to the user to call the necessary files.
